# Project Description: The Book Connect project is a web application that display books from an API
#                      As a junior software developer, I was given html and css files and I was instructed not to change them because the
#                      client was happy with the the design and styling of the project.
#                      My responsibity was to add functionality to the web application using Vanilla Javascript, the programming language #                      added interactiving and complexity to the website, to achieve the user experiences described here.
#                      To successfully complete this task, I made used of a number of javascript topics such as DOM Manipulation, ES6,  
#                      JS modules, functions, objects, arrays, just to name a few.

# Instructions: To use the application, a user needs a smartphone or a desktop, and an internet connection,
#               The application display 36 books on the first page, the user can use the "show more" to scroll and render more books
#               There is a seach button that allows the user to filter books by title, author and genres
#               There is also a settings button in which the user can toggle between light and dark mode;

# The Project Milestone is to achieve the following user experiences:
#     As a user, I want to view a list of book previews, by title and author, so that I can discover new books to read.
#     As a user, I want an image associated with all book previews so that I can recognize a book by the cover even if I forgot the name.
#     As a user, I want to have the option of reading a summary of the book so that I can decide whether I want to read it.
#     As a user, I want to have the option of seeing the date that a book was published so that I can determine how easy it is to obtain 
#     second-hand.
#     As a user, I want to find books based on specific text phrases so that I donâ€™t need to remember the entire title of a book.
#     As a user, I want to filter books by author so that I can find books to read by authors that I enjoy.
#     As a user, I want to filter books by genre so that I can find books to read in genres that I enjoy.
#     As a user, I want to toggle between dark and light modes so that I can use the app comfortably at night.
